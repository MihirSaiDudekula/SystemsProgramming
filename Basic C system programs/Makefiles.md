### Introduction to C Programming - Basics of Make Files

#### Overview of GCC Compilation
In the previous video, we explored **GCC**, which allows us to compile a project consisting of multiple files into a single binary. The command involved specifying each file to compile and providing an output name for the resulting binary.

#### Introduction to Make
**Make** is a utility program that simplifies the management of building C programs by automating compilation tasks. Instead of manually typing out compile commands for each file, Make allows us to define build rules and execute them with a single command.

#### Creating a Makefile
1. **Defining a Build**:
   - To create a **Makefile**, use the command `nano makefile`.
   - Inside the Makefile, define builds with specific names, required files, and the compilation command.

2. **Example Makefile**:
   ```makefile
   start: start.c add.c add.h
   	gcc start.c add.c add.h -o start
   ```

   - Here, `start` is defined as a build. It requires `start.c`, `add.c`, and `add.h` files. If these files are present, the command `gcc start.c add.c add.h -o start` will be executed.

#### Running Make
- To execute a build defined in the Makefile, use the command `make <build_name>`.
- Example: `make start`.
- Make checks if the required files are available and executes the corresponding command if they exist.

#### Practical Example
- Upon running `make start`, if `start` binary exists, Make confirms that `start` is up to date.
- Removing `start` and rerunning `make start` triggers the compilation command specified in the Makefile.
- Result: The `start` binary is successfully compiled.

### Execute the make
- Once the build process is complete , we can run the compilation `gcc`
command using the `./<build_name>`, which is in this case , `./start`
- This will compile the required code using the command `gcc start.c add.c add.h -o start` automatically


#### Advanced Uses of Make
- **Multiple Builds**: Make allows defining multiple builds with different configurations or requirements.
- **Variables and Scripts**: Makefiles support variables and can execute complex scripts, enhancing flexibility and automation.
- **Complex Builds**: Besides simple compilations, Make can manage flags, dependencies, and custom configurations for diverse project needs.

#### Conclusion
Makefiles provide a fundamental tool for managing and automating C program builds. They streamline the process of compiling projects by centralizing build commands into easily executable scripts. Understanding Make lays a crucial foundation for exploring more advanced build management techniques in C programming.

#### Code Generated
Below is the code generated based on the lecture:

```makefile
start: start.c add.c add.h
	gcc start.c add.c add.h -o start
```

This Makefile defines a build named `start` that compiles `start.c`, `add.c`, and `add.h` into an executable named `start`.
